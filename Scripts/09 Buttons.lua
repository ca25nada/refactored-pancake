USAGE:
___________________________________________________
Setup:

Some form of continous loop is required on the Screen for calling the BUTTON:UpdateMouseState() function. This is usually done via an update function.

Input callback function is required that will call BUTTON:SetMouseDown() and the BUTTON:SetMouseUp() functions. 
Currently, both take the Event.DeviceInput.button parameters but is currently unused.

Whenever a given screen initially comes on, BUTTON:ResetButtonTable() should be called to clear any pre-existing references to any buttons.
Otherwise you will likely see error messages relating to accessing actors that no longer exist.

___________________________________________________
Button Creation:
For any actor that you want to designate as a button, call BUTTON:AddButton() from the actor.
(Usually from the OnCommand, you will likely run into issues when calling from InitCommand from uninitialized actors.)

The function takes the following parameters:

Actor - actor
The Actor object you want to designate as a button, 
actor should have a non-zero positive value when actor:GetWidth()/actor:GetHeight() is called, but otherwise can be anything.

Screen - screen
The Screen object that the actor belongs to. This is needed to handle multiple overlapping screens.
e.g: if the actor specified above was created in ScreenSelectMusic, then the screen object for ScreenSelectMusic should be specified here.
	usually you can get this value via SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen()

int	- depth (optional, default = 0)
Some more complex buttons will usually involve an ActorFrame with multiple elements. Since the ActorFrame will have no width/height values,
the ActorFrame itself cannot be used as a button. However, you can create a child Actor with a defined width/height that will act as the button boundary for the actorframe.
The depth value corresponds to the number of nodes it needs to travel before reaching the "root" Actor/ActorFrame of the button.
e.g.: If there's an actorframe and a button child, the button child will specify a depth value of 1. When it's just the button as a standalone, the depth value should be specified as 0.

In addition, the Z value of the button actor is used to detect which button should be on top in the case of overlapping buttons.
This can be set by calling Actor:z(zValue).
The button who called BUTTON:AddButton() last will be considered as being on Top for tiebreakers.

Commands/Messages Broadcast:
None

___________________________________________________
Commands/Messages Unicast:

MouseOverCommand
Is played once when the mouse first goes over the specified button. The conditions are checked every time the BUTTON:UpdateMouseState() function is called.
ChildMouseOverCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

MouseOutCommand
Is played once when the mouse that was over an actor moves off the button. The conditions are checked every time the BUTTON:UpdateMouseState() function is called.
ChildMouseOutCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

MouseDownCommand
Is played once when the left click is pressed down for the first time while being over the button. The conditions are checked every time the BUTTON:SetMouseDown() function is called.
ChildMouseDownCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

MouseUpCommand
Is played once when the mouse is released while being over the button. The conditions are checked every time the BUTTON:SetMouseUp() function is called.
ChildMouseUpCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

MouseClickCommand
Is played once when both MouseDown and MouseUp events occur on the same button. The conditions are checked every time the BUTTON:SetMouseUp() function is called.
ChildMouseClickCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

MouseReleaseCommand
Is played once when a button was pressed, but released while the mouse was no longer over the button.  The conditions are checked every time the BUTTON:SetMouseUp() function is called.
ChildMouseReleaseCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

MouseDragCommand
Is played every time BUTTON:UpdateMouseState() is called while a button is considered to be held down (e.g. between MouseDown and MouseUp events).
The Following parameters are also passed:
	MouseX - X coordinates relative to the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.
	MouseY - Y coordinates relative to the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

ChildMouseDragCommand is also played for the actor designated as the "root" as specified by the depth value.

___________________________________________________
Limitations:

Button rollover detection only takes the following into account:

	X, Y coordinates of the Button Actors and its parent/direct ancestors.
	Rotations on the Z axis for the Button Actors and its parent/direct ancestors.
	Halign/Valign values of the Button Actor.
	Width/Height of the Button Actor.

Any other transformations applied on the actor or any of its parent/ancestors will cause the button rollover detection to fail.
	e.g. Skew, rotations on X/Y axis, zoom on parent actors.

Currently, BUTTON does not distinguish between different mouse buttons.
